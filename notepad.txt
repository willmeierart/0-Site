TO-DO: 
[] fix scroll on mobile, like really fix it...
[] start laying in boilerplate content
[] refactor scrolling to work differently:
  + it's the last subpage (or if there's no subpages) that scrolls right
  + there aren't really 'subpages' -- top level pages lock at the top and then scroll downward
[] start laying in Head content for SEO
[] make sure Jeremy understands - no subpages means no '/coupestudios' url, etc.



Detailed scroll notes:
+ horiz/vert page types ok
+ but what happens is:
  + for a top-lvl page:
    + first the high-lvl transition happens
      + the new route page either looks the exact same or is blank or something
      + the color fade maybe only goes a percentage of the way to the new color
      + the goal is to make it feel like the new page 'snaps' into place
    + so once you're there, as soon as you scroll, it doesn't immediately trigger ScrollOMatic
      + it triggers an animation (CSS / R.Motion / GSAP / ?) that slides the new page in sideways
      + it 'snaps' into place and then ScrollOMatic is released, you start scrolling down
  + but there ARE in fact subpages
    + these are similar-ish, there's a smooth transition between subpages
    + and then maybe some sort of animated 'slide-up' of a header or something
    + still vague
+ bottom line - there is the top level page animation (still variable via redux)
